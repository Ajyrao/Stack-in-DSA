# Stack-in-DSA
A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are inserted and removed from the same end. This implementation provides functionalities to push elements onto the stack, pop elements off the stack, peek at the top element without removing it, and check if the stack is empty.
